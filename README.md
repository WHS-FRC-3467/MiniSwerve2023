# MiniSwerve2013
This is the repo for Fall 2023 MiniSwerve project <br>
To get the code to deploy to the robot open the folder in VS code <br>
You can push changes for the robot to the remote even if you only have one of the folders open <br>
The constants for offsets are at the top of the constants file <br>
To change the offsets for the swerve module:
1. Turn the robot on and put it on its side and face all of the bevel gears of towards the side labeled on the bellypan <br>
1. Use a piece of box tube to make sure all of the wheels are aligned <br>
1. Then open up the shuffleboard and connect to the robot (Do not enable the robot) <br>
1. Find the boxes on the shuffleboard that are labeled cancoders 0-3 and copy their values into the constants file <br>
1. Deploy the code to the robot and check if the wheels are driving straight <br>
1. If not try and do the offsets again <br>
